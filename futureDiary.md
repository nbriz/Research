March 11th, 2030

	To my loyal subscribers and Patreon supporters,
    
    We did it folks. We just passed 200 million collective views on the channel. I just wanted to thank you all for this incredible achievement. Six years ago when I was still in school at ArtCenter, I never would've dreamt that I would be doing this now. Let alone that I'd have this kind of audience! When I started streaming myself painting it was only once every week, and just a project for my broadcasting class. Little did I know that one day it'd be my full time career and I'd have Forbes calling me "the Bob Ross of my generation"! I seriously can't thank you guys enough for this. I love you all!!
    
	Oh also, we just released some new merch to the webstore! These new hoodies are sooo sick. 		Check it out y'all!

:::::: DISADVANTAGED ::::::
March 11th, 2030

	I celebrated my 10th anniversary at Blick today. In June that'll be my fourth year as assistant manager. I can't believe it. Four years of undergrad at Parsons and another three post grad at RISD for this? I swear, I only got this job for the discount on paint, but here we are ten years on and shit doesn't change. There's no appreciation for painting anymore. They told me it was a dying medium, but I didn't believe them. You can't sell a piece until your name is Takashi fucking Murakami. Oh well. I've almost got enough saved up for a Cintiq now. Might give that a try soon. Start posting to my instagram again. Definitely get rid of my DeviantArt. We'll see.
